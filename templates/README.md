Welcome to the website creation of Pilates Plus with Amy! 

I am creating this website for my Pilates instructor who I have known for my whole life. For years she has allowed me to attend Pilates classes at no cost, so I decided to return the favor by creating a website for her. 

Having recently completed my first computer science course, I have gained a plethora of skills that can and may be used in this project. Enjoy!
